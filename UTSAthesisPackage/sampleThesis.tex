\begin{acknowledgements}
First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Xiaoyin Wang. Without his guidance, assistance and valuable time it would not be possible for me to finish my Master's thesis. Dr. Wang always helped me to develop an good understanding of the subject and gave me suggestions to improve the quality of my research results. Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank the rest of my dissertation committee: Prof. Palden Lama and Prof. Ali Tosun for their support, constructive feedback, and challenging questions. 

I thank the staff members of Computer Science department, Susan Allen and John Meriwether for all the administrative work they do for us. They helped me a lot during my Masters at UTSA. 

My sincerest gratitude and appreciation goes to my husband Foyzul Hassan for his constant support and assistance. I would also like to thank my parents and my brother for their never-ending love, care, support and encouragement throughout the completion of this Master of Science degree.

\emph{This Masters Thesis/Recital Document or Doctoral Dissertation
was produced in accordance with guidelines which permit the inclusion
as part of the Masters Thesis/Recital Document or Doctoral Dissertation
the text of an original paper, or papers, submitted for publication.
The Masters Thesis/Recital Document or Doctoral Dissertation must
still conform to all other requirements explained in the Guide for
the Preparation of a Masters Thesis/Recital Document or Doctoral Dissertation
at The University of Texas at San Antonio. It must include a comprehensive
abstract, a full introduction and literature review, and a final overall
conclusion. Additional material (procedural and design data as well
as descriptions of equipment) must be provided in sufficient detail
to allow a clear and precise judgment to be made of the importance
and originality of the research reported. }

\emph{It is acceptable for this Masters Thesis/Recital Document or
Doctoral Dissertation to include as chapters authentic copies of papers
already published, provided these meet type size, margin, and legibility
requirements. In such cases, connecting texts, which provide logical
bridges between different manuscripts, are mandatory. Where the student
is not the sole author of a manuscript, the student is required to
make an explicit statement in the introductory material to that manuscript
describing the students contribution to the work and acknowledging
the contribution of the other author(s). The signatures of the Supervising

\begin{abstract}
In the age of modern technology various game engines or game frameworks are used to develop games for different platforms and Unity is one of the most popular and commonly used game engines. Games, real-time 3d animations, etc. can be created using Unity's fully integrated development environment. Though Unity is mainly a game engine, it is also used to create various AR or VR apps used for medical, education and business purpose. Since Unity applications are being downloaded in a large number, it's high time to focus on the performance of Unity. For any kind of software product, performance is very important to indicate its overall quality. Software's quality or performance is deteriorated by different performance bugs and it can result in poor user experience, wasted computer resources. Though Unity is widely used and performance bug is as damaging as functional bugs, till now no research has been done on Unity's performance bugs. To provide researchers and developers further working on detecting, localizing and fixing performance bugs of Unity, we prepared a dataset of 230 performance bug fixing commits collected across 100 open source Unity project from GitHub. With our detail analysis we generated Unity's performance bug taxonomy which can be helpful for developers and future researchers. With our AST level code change analysis we identified that Unity's call-back method such as Update, Start, etc. are prone to performance issues and Unity performance fix commits are large due to code dependency issues. Apart from that our code change analysis also identified that performance fix can be in combination of source code and prefab files or sometimes only prefab files.

Fariha was born and brought up in Bangladesh, a small, beautiful country in South Asia. She earned her bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Military Institute of Science and Technology(MIST), Bangladesh. She enrolled in the Master's program at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in Fall 2017. As part of the Master's thesis, she started working under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoyin Wang. Her main research interest is in the performance optimization of AR and VR applications. She has been awarded UTSA Computer Science award, a competitive scholarship for her outstanding results.
