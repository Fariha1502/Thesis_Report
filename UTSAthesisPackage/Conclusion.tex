\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK}
\label{chap:conclusion}
In this study, we did an empirical analysis on \unity performance bugs derived from 230 performance bug fixing commits across 100 open source projects written in Unity. We manually investigated these commits to confirm that the fixes are related to Unity performance bugs.  In summary, we generated Unity performance bug taxonomy and Unity callback methods prone to performance bugs. Apart from that, our analysis performance bugs fix complexity identifies that \unity performance bugs are complex in nature and require to change in multiple code locations. Our commit change analysis also figured out that performance bugs can happen due to Unity GameObject Asset/Prefab Issues. As far as our knowledge, this is the first work on Unity performance bugs  and this work will be helpful for developers and researchers to identify performance issues.

In the future, we plan to generate a taxonomy of Unity asset or prefab related performance issues. Based on our current findings of code related performance bugs and asset-related finding, we plan to develop an analyzer to detect performance-related bugs. We also planned to build a tool to provide performance bug fix suggestions.
